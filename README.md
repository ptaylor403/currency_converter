# currency_converter

Currency:
  -Must be created with an amount and a currency code.
  -Must equal another Currency object with the same amount and currency code.
  -Must NOT equal another Currency object with different amount or currency code.
  -Must be able to be added to another Currency object with the same currency code.
  -Must be able to be subtracted by another Currency object with the same currency code.
  -Must raise a DifferentCurrencyCodeError when you try to add or subtract two Currency objects with different currency codes.
  -Must be able to be multiplied by an int or float and return a Currency object.
  -Currency() must be able to take one argument with a currency symbol embedded in it, like "$1.20" or "â‚¬ 7.00", and figure out the correct currency code. It can also take two arguments, one being the amount and the other being the currency code.

CurrencyConverter:
  -Must be initialized with a dictionary of currency codes to conversion rates (see link to rates below).
  -At first, just make this work with two currency codes and conversation rates, with one rate being 1.0 and the other being the conversation rate. An example would be this: {'USD': 1.0, 'EUR': 0.74}, which implies that a dollar is worth 0.74 euros.
  -Must be able to take a Currency object and a requested currency code that is the same currency code as the Currency object's and return a Currency object equal to the one passed in. That is, currency_converter.convert(Currency(1, 'USD'), 'USD') == Currency(1, 'USD').
  -Must be able to take a Currency object that has one currency code it knows and a requested currency code and return a new Currency object with the right amount in the new currency code.
  -Must be able to be created with a dictionary of three or more currency codes and conversion rates. An example would be this: {'USD': 1.0, 'EUR': 0.74, 'JPY': 120.0}, which implies that a dollar is worth 0.74 euros and that a dollar is worth 120 yen, but also that a euro is worth 120/0.74 = 162.2 yen.
  -Must be able to convert Currency in any currency code it knows about to Currency in any other currency code it knows about.
  -Must raise an UnknownCurrencyCodeError when you try to convert from or to a currency code it doesn't know about.
